A web application that analyzes customer call transcripts to generate:
- A **concise summary** of the call (2â€“3 sentences)  
- The **overall customer sentiment** (`Positive`, `Neutral`, or `Negative`)  

It uses the **Groq API** for advanced AI-powered analysis, with a **fallback keyword-based sentiment analyzer** when the API is unavailable. Results are saved to a CSV file and can be downloaded.
